# Barra-Model
An internship project: Implement Barra model to take risk or style factor attribution based on multi-factor model.

I have conducted the following steps:

1) Build a python file to automatically gather basic finance data from Wind Database.
2) Build a class containing 31 modified factors. It can realize automatically being contained in my own database.
3) Seperately build a regress and a risk class to calculate returns and risks of each specific factors.
4) Build a GUI using PyQt frame to show the result.

 You can use this GUI to complete all the analysis without knowing Python, just click some buttons.
